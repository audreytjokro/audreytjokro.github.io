Implemented the complete diffusion model sampling pipeline using DeepFloyd IF, exploring cutting-edge applications including inpainting, visual anagrams, and hybrid images. Built the DDPM sampling loop from scratch and applied classifier-free guidance for high-quality generation. I have hands-on experience with state-of-the-art generative AI, implementing both foundational algorithms and novel creative applications that push the boundaries of image synthesis.

**Key Implementation:** Forward and reverse diffusion processes with proper noise scheduling, iterative denoising with strided timesteps, classifier-free guidance for quality improvement, and creative applications like RePaint inpainting algorithm, visual anagram optical illusions, and factorized diffusion hybrid images.

**Technical Skills:** Diffusion model mathematics, PyTorch tensor operations, noise scheduling algorithms, manifold projection techniques, frequency domain decomposition
