Implemented classical stereo vision techniques for 3D scene reconstruction using photometric stereo and plane sweep algorithms. Recovered surface normals and albedo through illumination variation analysis, computed depth maps via normalized cross-correlation matching, and generated complete 3D mesh models. I wanted to explore more computer vision knowledge beyond neural methods to master fundamental geometric principles underlying modern 3D reconstruction systems.

**Key Implementation:** Photometric stereo using Lambertian reflectance models and least squares optimization, plane sweep stereo with NCC cost volume computation and winner-take-all depth selection, and 3D mesh reconstruction through surface integration and Poisson reconstruction techniques.

**Technical Skills:** Multi-view geometry, camera calibration, surface normal estimation, stereo matching algorithms, mesh generation, classical optimization methods
