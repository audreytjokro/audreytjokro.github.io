As someone interested in computer vision who had zero graphics programming experience, I built this real-time PBR material renderer from scratch using WebGL 2.0 to bridge the gap between my CV background and 3D graphics fundamentals. This project taught me the mathematical foundations of physically-based rendering, shader programming, and how light interaction models that power modern game engines and visualization tools actually work under the hood.
