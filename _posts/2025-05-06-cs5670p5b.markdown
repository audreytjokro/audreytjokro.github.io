In this second part of the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5670/2025sp/projects/5_project/partB.html">project</a>, I implemented and trained diffusion models from scratch on the MNIST dataset. 
I began by building a UNet for one-step denoising and then extended it into a time-conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). 
I trained the model to iteratively denoise noisy digits, resulting in realistic image generation from pure noise. 
Later, I incorporated class-conditioning to guide the model to generate specific digits using classifier-free guidance. 
Through this project, I gained deeper insights into diffusion model training, time-conditioning, and controllable image synthesis.
