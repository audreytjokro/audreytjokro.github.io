Implemented a complete autostitch system that combines multiple overlapping photographs into seamless panoramic images. Built both translation-based alignment (with spherical warping for 360Â° panoramas) and homography-based alignment for planar scenes. I worked on algorithm implementation, pipeline optimization, and testing with both provided datasets (Campus, Yosemite) and original photography sequences.

**Key Implementation:** Complete pipeline including spherical coordinate transformation with radial distortion correction, robust RANSAC-based inter-image alignment, SVD-based homography estimation, and advanced feathering blends with drift correction for seamless composition.

**Technical Skills:** RANSAC robust estimation, projective geometry, spherical warping, homography mathematics, SVD applications, image blending algorithms
