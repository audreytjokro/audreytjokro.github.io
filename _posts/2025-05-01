In this <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5670/2025sp/projects/5_project/partA.html">project</a>, I implemented and experimented with DeepFloydâ€™s pretrained diffusion models to understand how they generate realistic images from noise. I explored tasks such as forward diffusion, one-step and iterative denoising, classifier-free guidance (CFG), inpainting, SDEdit-style editing, hybrid images, and visual illusions. 
This hands-on work deepened my understanding of sampling loops, noise prediction, and the power of diffusion models in creative image synthesis and restoration.
